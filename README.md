Mimick the way Automatic market maker works in real time. Uses the exmaple of decentralized etherium transactions accessed using POSTMAN. Just run using node and then use POSTMAN to send a post message to '/buy-asset'. set 'quantity : ' to any number as to mimick the number of etherium bought on websites such as binance and coinDCX. As soon as you send the request, you will see that a value in USDC is shown for the entered quantity. Now sending more post requests will show you that the value in USDC is increasing as it mimicks how the value of something increases as the demand inreases. Similarly send a post request to '/sell-asset' to sell the entered 'quantity'. Now sending more requests will show that the value in USDC is decrementing, as value decreases if there are many buyers
